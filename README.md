# simple-python-slam
just a simple python slam

This branch is for doing slam by structure from motion, which I tried but couldn't get to work. Without lots of different angles of the scene geometry and without budle adjustment, the camera poses just have too much error. The code is totally unpolished and not well documented, but it's here if you want to try it out.

use python 3.11 in a conda environment, and do `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
